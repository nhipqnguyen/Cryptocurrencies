# Cryptocurrencies
## Project Overview
In this project, I used unsupervised learning to create an analysis for the clients who were preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market. I created a report that included what cryptocurrencies were on the trading market and used clustering algorithm to find out how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. I then used Pandas and Plotly to visualize my findings with the board.

## Resources
Data Source: crypto_data.csv

## Results
Using K-means algorithm, we classify 532 tradable cryptocurrencies into 3 clusters and create the following visualizations:
- a 3D scatter plot illustrating the three clusters
- a table with tradable cryptocurrencies
- a scatter plot with the total number of coins mined on the x-axis and the total coin supply on the y-axis for each tradable coin.
