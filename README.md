# Cryptocurrencies
## Project Overview
Our assignment is to use unsupervised learning to create an analysis for our clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market. We create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and use clustering algorithm to find out how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. We then use data visualizations to share our findings with the board.

## Resources
Data Source: crypto_data.csv

## Results
Using K-means algorithm, we classify 532 tradable cryptocurrencies into 3 clusters and create the following visualizations:
- a 3D scatter plot illustrating the three clusters
- a table with tradable cryptocurrencies
- a scatter plot with the total number of coins mined on the x-axis and the total coin supply on the y-axis for each tradable coin.
